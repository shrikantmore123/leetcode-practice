### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val`.

Consider the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

- Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.

- Return `k`.

### Example 1:

**Input:** nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3

**Output:** 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]

**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

### Example 2:

**Input:** nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2

**Output:** 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]

**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

---

### Constraints:

- `0 <= nums.length <= 100`

- `0 <= nums[i] <= 50`

- `0 <= val <= 100`

---

### Approach (Two Pointers / Filtering)

- Maintain an `index` pointer for placing valid elements.

- Traverse array:

    - If `nums[i] != val`:

        - Assign `nums[index] = nums[i]`

        - Increment `index`

- Return `index` as count of valid elements.

---

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int index = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if(nums[i] != val) {
                nums[index] = nums[i];
                index++;
            }
        }

        return index;
    }
}
```

### Time & Space Complexity

- Time Complexity: `o(n)`

- Space Complexity: `O(1)`

---

### Notes

- Does in-place modification without extra space.

- Order is not important, so flexible approach works.

- Similar pattern to remove duplicates problem.

- Classic filtering problem using two pointers.
