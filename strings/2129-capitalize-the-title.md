# 2129. Capitalize the Title (LeetCode 2129)

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Topics:** String

**Tags:** String Manipulation, Case Conversion, Simulation

**LeetCode Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/capitalize-the-title/

---

### Problem Statement

You are given a string `title` consisting of one or more words separated by a single space, where each word consists of English letters. Capitalize the string by changing the capitalization of each word such that:

- If the length of the word is `1` or `2` letters, change all letters to lowercase.

- Otherwise, change the first letter to uppercase and the remaining letters to lowercase.

Return the capitalized `title`.

### Example 1:

**Input:** title = "capiTalIze tHe titLe"

**Output:** "Capitalize The Title"

**Explanation:** Since all the words have a length of at least 3, the first letter of each word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.

### Example 2:

**Input:** title = "First leTTeR of EACH Word"

**Output:** "First Letter of Each Word"

**Explanation:** The word "of" has length 2, so it is all lowercase.
The remaining words have a length of at least 3, so the first letter of each remaining word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.

### Example 3:

**Input:** title = "i lOve leetcode"

**Output:** "i Love Leetcode"

**Explanation:** The word "i" has length 1, so it is lowercase.
The remaining words have a length of at least 3, so the first letter of each remaining word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= title.length <= 100`

- `title` consists of words separated by a single space without any leading or trailing spaces.

- Each word consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and is non-empty.

---

### Approach (Split + Case Handling)

- Split string into words.

- Convert each word to lowercase.

- If word length > 2:

    - Capitalize first letter

- Append words with space using `StringBuilder`.

---

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public String capitalizeTitle(String title) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String[] words = title.split(" ");

        for(int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            String w = words[i].toLowerCase();

            if(w.length() > 2) {
                w = Character.toUpperCase(w.charAt(0)) + w.substring(1);
            }

            sb.append(w);
            if(i < words.length - 1) {
                sb.append(" ");
            }
        }

        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

### Time & Space Complexity

- Time Complexity: `o(n)`

- Space Complexity: `o(n)`

---

### Notes

- Always convert word to lowercase first to simplify logic.

- Then apply capitalization condition.

- Uses extra space due to split and StringBuilder.
